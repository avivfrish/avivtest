The following information will provide a short overview and instruction necessary for applying the task.<br>

<b>Overview</b><br>
Matching is a crucial element of integrating structured and
semi-structured data.<br>
For instance, when multiple organizations are merged and has to transfer the data
between systems or when new system is introduced and the data has to migrate.
Matching schemata is the first step in this process.
The matching aimed at finding correspondences between a target and candidate schema. <br>
Human-in-the-loop data integration, and specifically in
matching, has been recently challenged by the big data era.
With richer data source variety, bigger volumes, and faster
velocity, accessing and making use of humans input has become
much harder. <br>
Recently, the traditional paradigm of â€œhumans do it better"
was challenged with a recent work showing that human judgment
is biased, and thus affects human matching abilities. <br>
Acknowledging cognitive awareness in human matching, InCognitoMatch <b>I</b>ntroducing <b>C</b>ognitive <b>B</b>iases
to <b>C</b>rowdsourced <b>M</b>atching is a handy tool to validate, annotate, and correct correspondences
using the crowd whilst accounting for human
matching biases

 <b>The Task</b><br>

 There are three parts to the task:
 <br>
 (1) User information.
 <br>
 (2) Logical riddles.
 <br>
 (3) Training phase.
 <br>
 (4) Actual task.

 In the second stage, you will encountered some logical riddles.
 You will have 3 minutes at most to answer all,
 Try answer on as much as you can.

 The third and fourth part contains the matching task, where the training
 phase is short part aimed at introducing you the system.
 While the third part lasts unlimited time, the fourth part is constrained
 to 3 minutes.

 During the task, you will introduced 2 schemata, one stands for candidate and the other as target.
 In each level, a pair will be shown to you. A pair is 2 terms, one from the candidate schema
 and the other from target schema.
 Your mission is to decide whether pair is a match and to scale your confidence level.
 <br>
 Regarding each pair, the following information will be provided for each term:
 name, type, hierarchy, instances (if exist), system suggestion, and
 majority decision.

 The figure above shows an example to screen exp that you will see.
 <br>
 The color legend in the hierarchy:
 <br>
 <em style="color: green">Green</em> - Parent of the term in the hierarchy.
 <br>
 <em style="color: red">Red</em> - The Term.
 <br>
 <em style="color: blue">Blue</em> - Sibling of the term in the hierarchy.
