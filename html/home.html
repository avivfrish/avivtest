 WELCOME TO INCOGNITOMATCH

The following information will provide a short overview and instruction necessary for applying the task.<br><br>

<h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">
 Overview
</h3>
Matching is a crucial element of integrating structured and
semi-structured data.<br>
For instance, when multiple organizations are merged and has to transfer the data
between systems or when new system is introduced and the data has to migrate.
Matching schemata is the first step in this process.
The matching aimed at finding correspondences between a target and candidate schema. <br>
Human-in-the-loop data integration, and specifically in
matching, has been recently challenged by the big data era.
With richer data source variety, bigger volumes, and faster
velocity, accessing and making use of humans input has become
much harder. <br>
Recently, the traditional paradigm of “humans do it better"
was challenged with a recent work showing that human judgment
is biased, and thus affects human matching abilities. <br><br>
Acknowledging cognitive awareness in human matching, InCognitoMatch <b style="font-size: x-large;">I</b>ntroducing

matching biases

 The Task
</h3>
In the main part of the session, several pairs will be introduced.
Each pair consists a term from the candidate schema
and a term from target schema. <br>
Regarding each pair, supplementary properties regarding
the matching problem will be introduced including
term names and types, instance examples, schemata hierarchy,
algorithm matching result and the majority decision of the crowd. <br>

Your task is to provide feedback, stating whether a pair is a match
accompanied by a confidence level in the decision on a [0,100] scale
You will have to achieve as many matching questions as possible within a
limited time frame.<br>

<!--(appearing on the screen’s top right part).
 In Figure 2, we see a request regarding a pair of
 unitOfMeasure and uom. Both terms share the same type
 (string) and the system’s suggestion is 0.4. An instance of
 unitOfMeasure is ‘kg’ and uom instance is ‘g’. The direct
 parent of unitOfMeasure is Item and a sibling term is, for
 example unitPrice. When achieving a matching decision, a
 user may browse this information, while InCognitoMatch
 records her mouse movements in the background.

There are three parts to the task:
<br>
(1) User information.
<br>
(2) Logical riddles.
<br>
(3) Training phase.
<br>
(4) Actual task.

In the second stage, you will encountered some logical riddles.
You will have 3 minutes at most to answer all,
Try answer on as much as you can.

The third and fourth part contains the matching task, where the training
phase is short part aimed at introducing you the system.
While the third part lasts unlimited time, the fourth part is constrained
to 3 minutes.


Regarding each pair, the following information will be provided for each term:
name, type, hierarchy, instances (if exist), system suggestion, and
majority decision.

The color legend in the hierarchy:
<br>
<b style="color: green">Green</b> - Parent of the term in the hierarchy.
<br>
<b style="color: red">Red</b> - The Term.
<br>
<b style="color: blue">Blue</b> - Sibling of the term in the hierarchy.
