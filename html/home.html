 WELCOME TO INCOGNITOMATCH
</h1>

The following information provides a short overview and instructions necessary for participating in the task.<br><br>

<h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">
 Overview
</h3>
Matching is a crucial element of integrating structured and
semi-structured data. For instance, when multiple organizations are merged,
 both parties have to share information to be fused together into a new integrated system.

Matching schemata is the first step in this process.
Schema matching aims to find correspondences between concepts
describing the meaning of data sources.
Human-in-the-loop data integration, and specifically in matching,
has been recently challenged by the big data era.
With richer data source variety, bigger volumes,
and faster velocity, accessing and making use of humans’ input
has become much harder.<br>

Acknowledging cognitive awareness in human matching, InCognitoMatch (<b>In</b>troducing
<b>Cogni</b>tive Biases <b>to</b> Crowdsourced
<b>Match</b>ing) is a handy tool to validate, annotate, and correct correspondences
using the crowd.

 The Task
</h3>
 The task begins with providing personal information (e.g., nickname) and a (short) intelligence test.
 The intelligence test is restricted to 2 minutes. Try answering as many riddles as you can.<br>
 Subsequently, a subset of matching correspondences will be introduced.
 At the end, you will be able to analyze your performance using a dedicated dashboard.<br><br>

 In the main part of the session, several element pairs will be introduced.
 Each pair consists of two <b>terms</b>, one from a candidate schema and one from target schema.
 To accompany each pair, additional properties will be introduced including term names and types,
 instance examples, schemata hierarchy, algorithmic matching result and a majority decision of the other participants.<br><br>

 Your task is to provide feedback, stating whether a pair is a <b>match</b> (the two terms correspond) or <b>no match</b>
 accompanied by a confidence level in the decision on a [0,100] scale. Please note that you will not be able to choose confidence level of 50.
 During the task, you will have a limited time frame to answer the matching questions.<br><br>

 The figure above illustrates the matching task using a matching
 question regarding the pair <em>quantity</em> and <em>qty</em>.<br><br>

The top right part provides an indication of the time remaining for the whole task.<br>

 The two sides of screen show information about the two terms.
 Each term name appears clearly on top and marked in red in the center of the screen.<br>
 Following the name, the data types and instance examples are introduced.
 In this example, the types of <em>quantity</em> and <em>qty</em> are “Decimal” and “int”, respectively.
 An example instance of <em>quantity</em> is 4580.55 and <em>qty</em> instance is 35<br>

The center part of the screen displays the schemata hierarchy.
The color legend is as follows:<br>
<b style="color: green">Green</b> - Parents of the term.<br>
<b style="color: red">Red</b> - The term.<br>
<b style="color: blue">Blue</b> - Siblings of the term.
<br>
The direct parent of <em>quantity</em> is <em>Item</em> and a sibling term is, for
example, <em>unitOfMeasure</em>.<br>
As demonstrated below,
the algorithm matching result is 29% and the majority decision of the crowd is 72.3%,
 both indicating a match decision.<br>
 Finally, the decision should be made (match\no match), the respective confidence should be selected
 and then press on the “submit” button.<br><br>

 Task Settings
</h4>

At this point there are two types of tasks - a short demonstration ("DEMO") or full task ("TASK").
For the full task participants, the task will begin with a short period for training. <br>
The demo takes about 5 minutes where the full task may last up to 20 minutes.<br><br>

By proceeding to the task, you approve having your personal information and task results stored in the system.
This data will be used for academic research only.<br><br>

Click on the button DEMO if you would like to participate in a short demonstration. <br>
Otherwise, click on the TASK button.<br>
